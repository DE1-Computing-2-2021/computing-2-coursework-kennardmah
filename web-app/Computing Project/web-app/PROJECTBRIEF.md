# PROJECT BRIEF

This webass displays a calendar that moves accross different months when pressing left or right located next to the month. The current date is also highlighted in the calendar.

The main challenge was to align the dates to match the weekdays for each specific months. This was achieved by using the dates from the prior month to fill in spaces so that the rest of the dates would align automatically as you switch the dates.

The second portion of the webapp is a tasklist labeled as deadlines. This way, the user will be able to store tasks while simultaneously looking at the calendar to see as the deadline approaches. The tasks can be labeled completed once done or deleted at anytime with a simple button.
